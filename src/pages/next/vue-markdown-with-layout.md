Stay in the mindset and build your doc in Vue with improved support for Vue markdown:

* Use the same script tag for your Javascript as your Vue components.
* Directly embed Vue components inside your markdown.

* Documentation compo Props component to automatically generate Props documentation from your component code documentation.
* Use layout to quickly write easy-to-digest documentation by adding navigation, logos, and more. A ready-to-use layout is now available in our [Vue documentation kit](https://studio.backlight.dev/edit/JwppqaVhCm2NyL9qmkDM/introduction/doc/index.md?p=doc), to benefit from all the above features right out of the box.
